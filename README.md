# Foodies ‚Äî Delicious Recipes App

No more waiting to get the right choice of recipe and spending lots of time searching Youtube on the right video to show how to make it.
It's all here now.
**Foodies** is the home of more than _thousands_ of recipes that are listed on basis of various regions and categories, which
you can take advantage of to find THE one you're looking for, almost instantaneously. Give this a ‚≠ê if you liked!

## üè≠ Contribute

This is one of my side projects which I made to learn the following:

- React (Fundamentals)
- Context API (For state management)
- Tailwind CSS (An utility first CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A set of pre-made react components)
- And many little _reacty_ things...

## üéâ Getting Started

Make sure you fork it, to make your copy of the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/NiharikaSahu-12/foodies.git`

Now it's damn easy.

**Install the dependencies (using `npm` or `yarn`**

- Using `npm`: `npm install`

**Starting project locally**

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

**Extra information**

- You can run `start` command just to run the react project and see how it works.
- You have to run `dev` command if you want to fiddle with the **tailwind classnames** as it needs to be processed (or watched).

Thanks!!
